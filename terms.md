          </ul>

          <p class="mb-5">I do not guarantee that the site will work with other browsers, but it's very likely that it will just work.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-3">Rights</h3>

          <p>You don't have to provide your real name when you register to an account. You do however need a valid email address if you want to upgrade your account to the paid version, or receive reminders by email.</p>

          <p>You have the right to close your account at any time.</p>

          <p>You have the right to export your data at any time, in the SQL format.</p>

          <p>Your personal data will not be shared with anyone without your consent.</p>

          <p>Your data is backed up every day.</p>

          <p>If the site ceases operation, you will receive an opportunity to export all your data before the site dies.</p>

          <p class="mb-5">Any new features that affect privacy will be strictly opt-in.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-3">Responsibilities</h3>

          <p>You will not use the site to store illegal information or data under the Canadian law.</p>

          <p>You have to be at least 18+ to create an account and use the site.</p>

          <p>You must not abuse the site by knowingly posting malicious code that could harm you or the other users.</p>

          <p>You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</p>

          <p class="mb-5">I reserve the right to close accounts that abuse the system (thousands of contacts with hundred of thousands of reminders for instance) or use it in an unreasonable manner.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-3">Other important legal stuff</h3>

          <p>Though I want to provide a great service, there are certain things about the service I cannot promise. For example, the services and software are provided “as-is”, at your own risk, without express or implied warranty or condition of any kind. I also disclaim any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. Monica will have no responsibility for any harm to your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or Software.</p>

          <p>These Terms can change at any time, but I'll never be a dick about it. Running this site is a dream come true to me, and I hope I'll be able to run it as long as I can.</p>
