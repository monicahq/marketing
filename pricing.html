        <h3 class="font-weight-normal mb-3">How do I cancel my subscription?</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">You can cancel anytime you want. To do that, simply go to your settings, under subscriptions, and cancel your account. That’s it.  You'll continue to have full access to Monica until the end of your trial or current billing period. After cancellation, you'll retain access to your account until the next time you're ready to use Monica.</p>

        <h3 class="font-weight-normal mb-3">Are there any long-term commitments or cancellation fees?</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">There are no hidden fees, ever. There are also no commitments whatsoever. You are free to leave whenever you want. You can upgrade, downgrade, cancel and delete your account when you want. There are no cancellation fees.</p>

        <h3 class="font-weight-normal mb-3">Is my data safe?</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">We do our best to make the most secure software. Monica is open source, and the source code is scrutinized by thousands of eyes. That being said, nothing is ever safe when it’s online. This is why we offer you the possibility to install Monica on your server, for free.</p>

        <h3 class="font-weight-normal mb-3">What is an open source project?</h3>
        <p class="mb-5">Monica is an open source project. That means the code is publicly available on GitHub, and everyone can inspect it, modify it or enhance it. That also means anyone can install Monica on a server she owns.</p>
