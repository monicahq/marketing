## Overview

The Country object is used in collaboration with the Address object. It
represents a country a contact lives in. The Country's API only allows read, as
there are not many new countries that are created every day. When you create an
address and need to indicate a country, use the Country object to retrieve the
`country_id` that you need for the address.

## List all the countries

Countries are order alphabetically.
