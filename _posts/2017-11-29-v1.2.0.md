Adding and managing tasks is now easier than ever in Monica.

We've leveraged our work on [v1.1](https://monicahq.com/v1.1.0.html) to allow the management of the tasks right from the contact view page, instead of having to open a new screen to enter task info, or having to wait for a page reload when you delete a task.

Also, and this is an important change, tasks now use checkboxes. Finally. This is something that we wanted to do for a long time.

These changes are in the version 1.2.0 which is already in production, and as always, you can install it on a server that you own.

Enjoy!
