Keeping track of what you said to the people you care about is important. It was
already possible to store notes about your contacts. Now you can also log a
phone call, which will be super convenient to know when you last called someone
and what you talked about during this call.

Version 0.4.0 is already in production, and as always, you can install it on a
server that you own.

Enjoy!
