Notes can now be set as a favorite. Favorites are a great way to keep track of notes that you find interesting.

When a note is set as favorite, it will appear in a new tab on the dashboard, called `Important notes`.

In this release, we've also released some goodies:
* Some actions in the UI now have dynamic notifications when adding/updating/deleting data.
* It's now possible to change account's owner first and last names

These changes are in the version 1.3.0 which is already in production, and as always, you can install it on a server that you own.

Enjoy!
